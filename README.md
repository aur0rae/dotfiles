# Dotfiles
My current Sway dots!

I'm using a fairly simple vanilla config of everything right now, but this should help minimize the 
amount of trips I have to make to the Arch Wiki :3

For any configuring of i3/Sway theming, I cannot recommend this site enough.It provides a nice web UI
to generate a config you can simply copy and paste into `~/.config/sway/config`. Super awesome project
and it made my life way easier switching from KDE Plasma.
